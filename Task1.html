        <p>I have loved drawing architecture since childhood. It started when we needed to create a house plan, and I did it myself, which I really enjoyed. Sometimes I sit and just watch designs and different architectural solutions. In this image, you can see my first house drawing ;)</p>

        <p>I have been involved in sports since childhood; sports are an integral part of my life. I love boxing because I used to cheer for Gennady Golovkin as a child, and I enjoy it.</p>
